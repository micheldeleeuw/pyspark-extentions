# pyspark-extentions
Library with extensions to the PySpark dataframe object. This is a my personal library. No support provided.

To use the library, import pyspark_extentions, after which the default PySpark DataFrame object is extended with a bunch of methods. They all start with `e` to distinguish them from the default methods.
